## FAQ for Sales Team

**Q: Can we do month-to-month Enterprise?**
A: Yes, but annual commitment gets 2 months free. Push for annual.

**Q: What if they only need 20 users?**
A: Team plan ($49/mo) may be better fit. Enterprise starts making sense at 50+ users.

**Q: Can we match competitor pricing?**
A: Get manager approval. Usually better to sell value than race to bottom.

**Q: Do we offer free trials for Enterprise?**
A: Yes, 14-day POC (proof of concept) with limited features. Full trial requires manager approval.

**Q: What's our refund policy?**
A: 30-day money-back guarantee. After that, annual contracts are non-refundable but can be credited to future purchases.
